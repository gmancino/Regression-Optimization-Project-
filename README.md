# Regression-Optimization-Project-

This is MATLAB code for performing classification with logisitic regression on the two datasets in this repository.
This was done as a project for Dr. Yangyang Xu's *Introduction to Optimization* course (Fall 2018).

If you want to run this yourself, have all of the files in the same directory and run the **RunMe.m** file.
